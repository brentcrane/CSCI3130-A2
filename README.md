My software engineering assignment 2 repository.

I first commited stage 1, which went fine.
I then did stage 2, but I don't think I actually pushed it to Git...
So I carried on and completed stage 3, and pushed it.
I then went back to stage 2, and pushed it.

That's why stage 3 appears first on Github.
Sorry about that, my mistake.
